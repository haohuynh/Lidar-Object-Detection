# Writeup: Track 3D-Objects Over Time

Please use this starter template to answer the following questions:

## Midterm Write-up

The below questions will be answered by the end of the final project.

The midterm is great. It gives me the chances to recap all the exercises as well as to troubleshoot the issues comning while using the libs and doing calculations on the data. Without the project instructions, everything is extremely complex. It takes a huge of time to actually go through all the data structures, and to observe how then can be transformed in each single step.

Visualization is the most important thing for it helps me to actuall see/understand how Lidar works. 

Please comment all the visualization (e.g., ID_S2_EX1/2/3) for observing the below statistics

### 1. Write a short recap of the four tracking steps and what you implemented there (filter, track management, association, camera fusion). Which results did you achieve? Which part of the project was most difficult for you to complete, and why?


### 2. Do you see any benefits in camera-lidar fusion compared to lidar-only tracking (in theory and in your concrete results)? 


### 3. Which challenges will a sensor fusion system face in real-life scenarios? Did you see any of these challenges in the project?


### 4. Can you think of ways to improve your tracking results in the future?
