# Writeup: 3D-Objects Detection

## Midterm Write-up
This is a pre-setup project. Every single step has its own configurations. I have followed the instructions stricly and haved tested all exercises out successfully, so if you are going to review them in a different configuation, please be plexible. For example, in ID_SE3_EX2, line 231 in detect_object.py: detections = detections[0].get(1) # Unpack the actual detections, please be flexible with the Dictionary vs. Tensor when you are using fpn_resenet vs. darknet. See below images for the evidents. Anyways, I have added the flexibility to your code. But, in general, please be extremely flexibile with the code, configuarations, and pre-setup files.
