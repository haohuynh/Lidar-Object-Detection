# Writeup: 3D-Objects Detection

## Midterm Write-up
This is a pre-setup project. Every single step has its own configurations. I have followed the instructions and haved tested them out successfully, so if you are going to review them in a different configuation, please be plexible. For example, in ID_SE3_EX2, line 231 in detect_object.py: detections = detections[0].get(1) # Unpack the actual detections, please be flexible with the Dictionary and List. See below images for the evidents.
